          <p>
            When using SCSS (Sass) in an Angular component, there are a few
            potential reasons why global class styles may not be applied as
            expected. Here are some common issues and their solutions:
            Specificity Issues: CSS follows a specificity hierarchy, which means
            that styles with higher specificity will override styles with lower
            specificity. If the global styles have lower specificity than the
            component styles, the component styles will take precedence.
            Solution: To ensure that global styles take precedence, you can
            increase the specificity of the global styles by using more specific
            selectors, such as using parent elements or applying styles directly
            to the elements you want to style globally. Order of Import: The
            order in which you import your SCSS files matters. If you import the
            component's SCSS file before the global SCSS file, the component
            styles might override the global styles. Solution: Make sure to
            import the global SCSS files first, followed by the
            component-specific SCSS files.<br />
            The order should be: CSS Modules or View Encapsulation: Angular uses
            view encapsulation by default, which means that styles defined in a
            component's SCSS file are scoped to that component and don't affect
            other components. This can lead to global styles not applying to
            your component. Solution: If you want your component to use global
            styles, you can disable view encapsulation for that component by
            setting the ViewEncapsulation to ViewEncapsulation.None in the
            component's metadata. typescript Copy code Be cautious when
            disabling view encapsulation, as it can lead to unintended side
            effects and CSS conflicts. <br />
            Specificity Conflicts: If you have conflicting class names between
            your component's SCSS and global SCSS, the styles of one may
            override the other. Solution: Ensure that your class names are
            unique or have distinct names to avoid conflicts between
            component-specific and global styles. <br />
            Angular CLI and Style Preprocessors: If you're using the Angular CLI
            to generate components, it may include a default style encapsulation
            option. Ensure that your component's styles are written in SCSS and
            not in CSS or another preprocessor. <br />
